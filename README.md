# Program to encrypt and decrypt images using XOR

## Overview
This program allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt images in a folder.
Running the program in a folder will encrypt all images in that folder and create a special file needed for decryption.
If the program is run again and the decryption file exists in the folder, it will decrypt the images.
